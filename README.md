This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating an uncommon error handling scenario. The code showcases how to gracefully handle both ZeroDivisionError (division by zero) and TypeError exceptions within a single function, providing robust error management and user-friendly messages.  The solution provides enhanced error handling to avoid unexpected behavior when dealing with different input types or invalid operations.
